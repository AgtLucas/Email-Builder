# grunt-EmailBuilder

Emails Suck. Seriously. Combine Html and Css into an email 

What this will do Eventiually 

Read Less (one for inline css, one for an inline style tag) and Jade Files, combine into a Single Email html file.

This will then be curled  off to litmus. Eventually whatever email testing service  (Are there any others?) 

*** TODO ***

Inline second less file into style tag using jsDom  
Replace curl exec function with actualy http thingy (wtf).  
Get it to read Multiple Files lines (Need to look into grunt more, sure Im doing this wrong.)
